                    <h2 className='faqSubHead'>Do I need a Spotify account?</h2>
                    <p className='paragraph'>Yes. As of right now, the only music platform that Repertoire works with is Spotify premium accounts. I am working towards integrating Apple Music, Tidal, Amazon, and other music streaming platforms in the near future.</p>

                    <h2 className='faqSubHead'>Can I still add songs to my Repertoire playlists?</h2>
                    <p className='paragraph'>Yes, you can. However, they will not show up on Repertoire. This is because Repertoire only tracks items added to the playlists through the website by other users.</p>

                    <h2 className='faqSubHead'>My username search isn&apos;t showing results, why?</h2>
                    <p className='paragraph'>Spotify usernames are case sensitive. Please make sure you are entering them correctly.</p>
